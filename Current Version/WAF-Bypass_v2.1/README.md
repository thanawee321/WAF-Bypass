## ðŸ¤¨ What is tool

This tool is designed to discover the real IP address hidden behind a WAF (Web Application Firewall) by using a brute-force subdomain enumeration technique to uncover hidden domains.
In addition, it can also retrieve DNS history to identify where the target web server or host was previously registered and which service providers it has been associated with. 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**BYPASS_WAF_APPLICATION** is a tool for:

- Detecting whether a website is protected by **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**  
- Checking web server information  
- Extracting **SSL certificate** information  
- Viewing **historical IP addresses** of a domain via `viewdns.info` and `securitytrails.com`  
- Scanning and finding **subdomains** with SSL analysis  
- Supporting **wordlists** for subdomain enumeration  

This tool is suitable for Bug Bounty hunters, Pentesters, and Security Researchers.
